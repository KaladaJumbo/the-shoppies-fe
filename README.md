## The Shoppies - Movie awards for entrepreneurs

### Challenge

Shopify has branched out into movie award shows and we need your help. 
Please build us an app to help manage our movie nominations for the upcoming Shoppies.

### Details 

We need a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

We'd like a simple to use interface that makes it easy to:
 + Search OMDB and display the results (movies only)
 + Add a movie from the search results to our nomination list
 + View the list of films already nominated
 + Remove a nominee from the nomination list


### Technical Requirements

+ Search results should come from OMDB's API (free API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
+ Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
+ Updates to the search terms should update the result list
+ Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
+ If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
+ Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.
